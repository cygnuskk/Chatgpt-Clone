Description:
Built a ChatGPT-like AI chatbot application that mimics conversational behavior using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer-based models. The project focused on delivering a human-like chat experience with context awareness and dynamic response generation.

Key Features:

Implemented a frontend chat interface using React.js or HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Integrated OpenAIâ€™s GPT API (or open-source alternatives like GPT-J or DialoGPT) for generating responses.

Managed user sessions and message history to preserve context in conversations.

Added features like typing indicators, message timestamps, and conversation reset.

Deployed the app on a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Vercel, Firebase, or Heroku).

Technologies Used:
React.js / Node.js / Python Flask, OpenAI API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Firebase / MongoDB / Express (adjust based on your tech stack).

Outcome:
Successfully developed a fully functional chatbot that demonstrates the capabilities of AI in real-time conversation, simulating natural human interaction with a clean UI/UX.
